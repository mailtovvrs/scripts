1.Rest API Tasks:
  ---------------

a)Automate single node ambari setup using Rest API's ------> CLUSTER BULD - COMPLETED

b)Automate multi node ambari setup using Rest API's -------> CLUSTER BUILD - COMPLETED

c)Automate service configs change using Rest API's --------> DISTRIBUTED CONFIGS UPDATE

d)Scale out additional nodes using Rest API's ------------> SCALABILITY BENEFIT

e)Automate cluster stop/start using Rest API's -----------> CLUSTER MANAGEMENT BENEFIT

f)Automate deploy components using Rest API's ------------> COMPONENT SCALABILITY BENEFIT

g)Automate services state using Rest API's ---------------> SERVICE MANAGEMENT BENEFIT - IN PROGRESS

h)Automate services health check using Rest API's ---------> SERVICE HEALTH CHECK BENEFIT


2.Script all the above Rest API Tasks to functions in Python
   
3.Using Jenkins to define different jobs like: cluster build job, configs update job, hosts scalability job, cluster management job, component scalability job,
service management job, service health check job

4. Schedule Jenkins job? ----- Is this possible?
