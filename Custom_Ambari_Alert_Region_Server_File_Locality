STEP1:
WE ARE CREATING METRIC TYPE ALERT WHICH MEANS THERE WOULD ONLY BE JSON FILE AND NOT THE SCRIPT(PYTHON)

STEP2:
JSON FILE WILL NEED TO BE CREATED IN THE FOLLOWING LOCATION:
/var/lib/ambari-server/resources/common-services/HDFS/2.1.0.2.0/package/alerts

STEP3:
CREATE AND REGISTER THE CUSTOM AMBARI ALERT USING THE FOLLOWING REST API:
curl -u admin:admin -i -H 'X-Requested-By:ambari' -X POST -d @filesLocal.json  http://lab-happ-01-a:8080/api/v1/clusters/Lab/alert_definitions

STEP4:
DO AMBARI RESTART SO THE CHANGES ARE PROPAGATED TO ALL NODES IN THE CLUSTER

STEP5:
IF THE STATUS CODE IS 201/OK THAT MEANS CUSTOM ALERT IS SUCCESSFULLY REGISTERED IN AMBARI

STEP6:
TO CHECK THE ALERT IS REGISTERED OR NOT USE THE FOLLOWING IN THE BROWSER:
http://lab-happ-01-a:8080/api/v1/clusters/Lab/alert_definitions/

STEP7:
USALLY THE CREATED ALERT WILL BE REGISTERED AS LAST IN ALERT DEFINITIONS:
eg:
http://lab-happ-01-a:8080/api/v1/clusters/Lab/alert_definitions/101

STEP8:
CHECK IN THE AMBARI IN ALERTS THE ALERT IS SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED OR NOT
